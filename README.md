# ElevenLabs Voice Demo

This repository contains a lightweight demo showing how ElevenLabs voice AI can be embedded into a simple web experience.

## What this demonstrates
- A simple example of how developers could integrate ElevenLabs voice APIs into a user-facing application
- How voice generation might be embedded into a basic customer interaction flow
- The type of lightweight demo that can support partner conversations, solution design, and developer onboarding

## How this was built
- Used OpenAI APIs alongside ElevenLabs voice APIs to generate and render voice responses in a simple interaction flow
- Built and tested locally using VS Code and the terminal to validate prompts, API calls, and user flows
- Designed as a lightweight front-end experience to keep the focus on voice interaction rather than UI complexity
- Deployed to Vercel to make the demo easily accessible and shareable

## Why I built this
I built this demo to get hands-on with ElevenLabs’ voice platform and better understand how enterprises might implement voice-based customer service agents within real workflows. The goal was to deepen my product understanding so I can work more effectively with partners on use cases, integrations, and go-to-market execution.
