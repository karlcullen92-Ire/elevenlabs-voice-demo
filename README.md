# ElevenLabs Voice Demo

This repository contains a lightweight demo showing how ElevenLabs voice AI can be embedded into a simple web experience.

## What this demonstrates
- How developers might integrate ElevenLabs APIs into a user-facing application
- A simple example of voice generation in a front-end flow
- How I think about partner-led GTM, developer experience, and ecosystem adoption

## Why I built this
I built this demo as part of my application for a Revenue Partnerships role at ElevenLabs, to show initiative and how I approach supporting partners and developers with practical, lightweight examples.
